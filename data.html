	<h2 id="cjeu">Building an infrastructure for multidisciplinary research of the Court of Justice of the European Union</h2>
	In my role as a postdoctoral fellow at Ume√• University, I am contributing to a multi-annual research environment project funded by the Swedish Research Council, establishing a comprehensive database with detailed information on all cases and judges of the Court of Justice of the European Union. Work on the project is ongoing, please feel free to reach out if you would like to learn more about the project and access to the data we are collecting.
	<h2 id="gfcc">The German Federal Constitutional Court in the German Bundestag's Parliamentary Debates</h2>
	In the course of my doctoral studies at UCL, I collected detailed information on German legislators' perceptions of jurisprudence issued by the German Federal Constitutional Court (GFCC). I read debate transcripts of every federal law published between 1977 and 2015, which had been subsequently reviewed by the GFCC and determined whether legislators had anticipated constitutional conflicts and recorded their responses to these expectations. Please feel free to reach out if you would like to learn more about this information and are interested in access to this data.
