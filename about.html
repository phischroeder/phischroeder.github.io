  <h2>About myself</h2>
	<p style="text-align:justify">I am a postdoctoral researcher at the <a style='color: black;' style='text-decoration: underline;' href="https://www.gsi.uni-muenchen.de/index.html" target="_blank">Department of Political Science</a> at Ludwig-Maximilians-University Munich, working at the <a style='color: black;' style='text-decoration: underline;' href="https://www.gsi.uni-muenchen.de/lehreinheiten/ls_vp/index.html" target="_blank">Chair of Comparative Politics</a>. I previously worked as a postdoctoral fellow at the <a style='color: black;' style='text-decoration: underline;' href='https://www.umu.se/en/department-of-law/' target='_blank'>Department of Law</a> at Ume√• University, and contributed to the multi-annual research environment project "Judicial independence under pressure? Building an infrastructure for multidisciplinary research of the Court of Justice of the European Union".</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">I received my doctoral degree from the <a style='color: black;' style='text-decoration: underline;' href="https://www.ucl.ac.uk/political-science/" target="_blank">Department of Political Science</a> at University College London in July 2019. My doctoral dissertation and current research projects focus on the strategic decision-making of courts, parliaments and governments in systems of separation of powers. Specifically, I am studying how interdependences between the judiciary, legislative and executive branches shape the choices of lawmakers and judges.</p>
  <p style="text-align:justify">Tying in with my interest in actors' strategic decision-making, I am applying formal theory to develop theoretical expectations about the behaviour of political and judicial institutions in systems of separation of powers. I employ both quantitative and qualitative research methods to evaluate whether empirical evidence is consistent with the theoretical expectations identified in my work.
